5 Exception Scenarios:

1) Throw an exception when a user tries to input something that doesn't match the data type you are trying to get (ask for int age; they input "Hi")
	reason: there are other errors that would pop up if you attempt to store a String as an int, or any other mismatched variable type

2) Throw an exception when trying to read in from a text file, but the text file is not found.
	reason: The rest of the code would not work if you are expecting to be able to extract data from the txt file.

3) Throw an exception when you are trying to build a deck in a card game, but the amount of cards you have either exceed the limit or are not at the minimum.
	reason: invalid number of cards in your deck would result in breaking the rules of the game.

4) Throw an exception when you attempt to log into an application, but the username is not in the database.
	reason: If the username doesn't exist, then the user either typed it in wrong, or they don't have an account; either way, they are not able to log in.

5) Throw an exception when you are trying to access an application that you no longer have the license to access anymore.
	reason: If the company that gives the license to the application doesn't deny access without it, then (assuming you have to pay for it) the company would lose money.
